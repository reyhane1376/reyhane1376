My name is Reyhaneh. I was born on September 11, 1997, and I have been passionate about the world of programming ever since. The story of my career in this field began in March 2021. Initially, I focused on front-end projects and became familiar with JavaScript, gaining valuable experiences.

However, I always wanted to delve deeper into coding and work as a professional developer. Therefore, in April 2022, I decided to move towards back-end development and started learning PHP. Initially, I became acquainted with raw PHP, and later I migrated to Laravel, one of the popular back-end frameworks.

My work experience in back-end development has greatly improved, allowing me to implement exciting and efficient projects using this powerful framework.

During my professional journey, I have participated in several important and exciting projects. Here are some of them:

# RoyalPayamak Project: 
In this project, I worked as a back-end developer and developed the RoyalPayamak website. This website was a platform for selling SMS packages and was designed and implemented using the Laravel framework. In this project, I was responsible for tasks such as user management, payments, and product pages.
